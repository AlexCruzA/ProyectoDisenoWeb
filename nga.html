				<strong>Qualifying history</strong><br>
				After impressing on their way to the second round in each of their first two FIFA World Cup™ appearances, in 1994 and 1998, Nigeria struggled in the finals before again returning to the knockout rounds in 2014. In Brazil they beat fancied Bosnia and Herzegovina before showing well in narrow defeats to eventual finalists Argentina and France. But the most populous nation in Africa always has high expectations, and they have had their eye on a first-ever African spot in the semi-finals for some time. Nigeria became the first African side to reach Russia 2018 thanks to their 1-0 victory over Zambia in their penultimate third round, Group B game. Fittingly it was Alex Iwobi, nephew of three-time World Cup veteran Jay Jay Okocha, who scored the goal that sent the Nigerians to their sixth global finals.<br> <br>

				<strong>The team</strong><br>
				In Vincent Enyeama the Super Eagles have arguably the best African goalkeeper, but the veteran captain is not the only Nigerian player of an international calibre. Players like John Obi Mikel, Sunday Mba, Joel Obi and Efe Ambrose have shown in Europe that they are capable of playing at the highest level. The success that the Nigerian youth teams are enjoying would also suggest that the seemingly never-ending stream of top class player will take the Super Eagles into a bright future.<br> <br>

				<strong>The coach</strong><br>
				German coach Gernot Rohr took charge of the Super Eagles in August 2016 and is one of the most experienced coaches in Africa. Since 2010, he has had coaching stints with Gabon, Niger and Burkina Faso. When he was named manager of the Super Eagles, he found the team going through a difficult period having missed their chance to participate in the CAF Africa Cup of Nations. His challenge now is clear: qualify for Russia 2018.<br> <br>

				<strong>The stat</strong><br>
				5 – The number of World Cup finals Nigeria have qualified for out of the last six events.<br> <br>

				<strong>The former stars</strong><br>
				Jay Jay Okocha, Nwankwo Kanu, Rashidi Yekini
