				<strong>FIFA World Cup™ finals history</strong> <br>
				Serbia played their first official international match as an independent nation on 16 August 2006, beating Czech Republic 3-1 away. Before then, they had been part of two countries that now no longer participate: Yugoslavia and Serbia and Montenegro. Serbia's inaugural independent FIFA World Cup qualifying campaign was for South Africa 2010, and they surprisingly booked their ticket to the tournament after emerging from a group with France, Austria, Lithuania, Romania and Faroe Islands. However, once there, the Beli Orlovi (White Eagles) were unable to make it past the group stage. Serbia failed to reach Brazil 2014, but will return to the global finals at Russia 2018 after winning qualifying Group D. They were defeated just once on the road to Russia, in their penultimate game in Austria, and saw off the challenge of the Republic of Ireland and Wales to finish top of the standings.<br><br>

				<strong>The team</strong> <br>
				Much like their predecessors, the current Serbia side are among Europe’s best in terms of technique, and the squad boasts a number of first-rate players, the majority of whom play in some of the continent’s top leagues in England, Italy and Germany. For example, Branislav Ivanovic is not only one of Serbia’s most experienced players, he is also one of the best full-backs in the Premier League. Aleksandar Kolarov and Matija Nastasic help him form a solid rearguard, while Filip Djuricic and Aleksandar Mitrovic are dangerous up front.<br><br>

				<strong>The coach</strong> <br>
				Slavoljub Muslin was named Serbia head coach after departure of Radovan Ćurčić. Though this is his first coaching appointment in international football, the former Red Star Belgrade and Lille defender has had a long coaching career at the club level, having managed clubs in France, Morocco, Bulgaria, Ukraine, Belgium, Russia, Belarus and Cyprus. In his native Serbia, Muslin led Red Star Belgrade to three domestic league titles. <br><br>

				<strong>The stat</strong> <br>
				11 – The number of World Cup tournaments Serbia have participated in. Between 1930 and 1998 Yugoslavia took part in nine finals; Serbia and Montenegro played at Germany 2006 and four years later Serbia reached South Africa.<br><br>
		
				<strong>The former stars </strong> <br>
				Stjepan Bobek, Dragan Dzajic, Branko Zebec, Mateja Kezman, Sinisa Mihajlovic, Savo Milosevic, Dejan Stankovic <br><br>
