				<strong>FIFA World Cup™ finals history</strong> <br>
				Chile have graced nine FIFA World Cups, the last two of them consecutive, a first for La Roja since the 1960s. Their best ever performance was third place on home soil in 1962, since when they have never progressed beyond the Round of 16, though they came close to breaking that run at Brazil 2014, where they lost on penalties to the hosts. The South Americans were one of the 13 nations to contest the inaugural world finals in 1930.<br><br>

				<strong>The team</strong> <br>
				The mainstays of Chile’s finest ever generation form the backbone of the side. Among them the solid and reliable Claudio Bravo between the posts; the versatile and inspirational Gary Medel; the tireless Arturo Vidal; and the elusive Alexis Sanchez.<br><br>

				<strong>The coach</strong> <br>
				FollAfter Jorge Sampaoli resigned from his post in January 2016, another Argentinian, Juan Antonio Pizzi, took over as coach of the national team. Pizzi's managerial career has taken him to his homeland Argentina, Peru, Chile, Spain and Mexico, where he was coach for Club Leon until taking the job with La Roja. Pizzi was a champion in Chile with Universidad de Chile in 2010 and in Argentina with San Lorenzo in 2013. In June 2016, he won the Copa America Centenario with Chile, defeating Argentina in the final on penalties.<br><br>
				"We are very pleased with the arrival of Juan Antonio Pizzi. He is a professional who gives us full confidence, has an established career, he has been champion in Chile and Argentina, in addition to good campaigns in Europe and Mexico," President of the Asociacion Nacional de Futbol Profesional Arturo Salah said when Pizzi was announced as head coach.
